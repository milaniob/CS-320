How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by having a clear outline, understanding user needs, and staying consistent throughout the coding process. User needs are integral to a program. It is important to get clear and concise software requirements that will help when outlining the coding process. Going into the coding process with caution and continuing it throughout is paramount to controlling any bias. Taking each part of the process step by step helps not missing critical points and accidentally cutting corners. Cutting those corners will slow down the entire process as you will have to go back and comb entire chunks of code to find your issues. Staying disciplined with these ideas will overall allow your coding process to be cleaner, more efficient, and completed in a timely manner.
